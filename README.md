# NumericalMethods_dynare

This course is the technical and tutorial part of the larger module “Global Macroeconomics”. Lectures aim at teaching how to solve and simulate quantitative macroeconomic models designed to explain business cycles and economic fluctuations. These models highlight the role of forward looking expectations and uncertainty in macroeconomics. Detailed program:

- *Recursive methods* and introduction to dynare;
- *Deterministic simulation*: solution of the Solow (1956) model, and simulation of the Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans (RCK) economy;
- *Real Business Cycle* (RBC) models, and introduction to log-linearization;
- Baseline *New Keynesian* (NK) models;
- *Optimal monetary policy* (discretion vs. commitment) in NK models;
- Topics in *Bayesian estimation*.

All the models are firstly introduced in their theoretical framework, to then learn how to simulate them in ${\color{purple} \texttt{dynare}}$.

## *Material*

The slides are all clustered in a unique PDF named ***Teaching_Perturbation_Methods***. Codes to each topic will be provided during lectures and indicated in the slides.

You can access to the ${\texttt{.mod}}$ files for dynare in the branch called "*codes*", or clicking [here](https://github.com/valeriodionisi/NumericalMethods_dynare/tree/codes). If you are interested in a ${\texttt{.mod}}$ file not published in such branch but that appears in the slides, drop me an [e-mail](v.dionisi@campus.unimib.it).
