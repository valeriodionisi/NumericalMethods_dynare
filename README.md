# NumericalMethods_dynare

This course is the technical and tutorial part of the larger module “Global Macroeconomics”. Lectures aim at teaching how to solve and simulate quantitative macroeconomic models designed to explain business cycles and economic fluctuations. These models highlight the role of forward looking expectations and uncertainty in macroeconomics. Detailed program:

a) Recursive methods and introduction to dynare;
b) Deterministic simulation: solution of the Solow (1956) model, and simulation of the Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans economy;
c) Real Business Cycle (RBC) models, and introduction to log-linearization;
d) Baseline New Keynesian (NK) models;
e) Optimal monetary policy (discretion vs. committment) in NK models;
f) Topics in Bayesian estimation.

All the models are firstly introduced in their theoretical framework, to then learn how to simulate them in dynare.
